            <h1>Exploring Novels in Hispaniola</h1>
            <p id="intro-content">
                This map showcases important locations in the novels "The Farming of Bones" by Edwidge Danticat and "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao" by Junot DÃ­az.<br><br>
                These two novels take place on the Island of Hispaniola, and at some points in the novels, during the same time period.<br><br>
                Many times, it is difficult to understand the connection between places in novels given the medium of writing.<br>
                The goal of this project is to map important locations in these novels to provide a connection to the real world and help build context and setting that reading alone cannot do.<br>
                <br>The pins on the map represent locations. Clicking or tapping on a pin will open a box that gives more information about that location. <br>The menu on the right side lists the locations. Click or tap on a location to jump to it and open it automatically. Feel free to scroll around get a sense of where these pins exist in relation to each other.
